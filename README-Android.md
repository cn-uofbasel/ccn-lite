========

Android build support is under development.  Because the methodologies for Android NDK-based development
are in flux, there are currently at least 4-5 supported ways to build projects:

* Android NDK
* Android SDK *(Command Line)
* Eclipse Android Plugin Based Builds
* Android Studio Based Builds
* Gradle Android Plugin (Command Line)
* Custom Makefiles
* Maven Android Plugin

It is not the goal of this Android integration to easily support all possible ways to build.  Instead, the project
shall focus on adding the most commonly understood approach to building JNI code with the Android NDK.

Status
======

The project currently will not build with the Android NDK.  Compilation will fail.
